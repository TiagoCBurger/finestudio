### 2. Client-Side Logging (✅ Already Implemented)

**Files**:
- `hooks/use-queue-monitor.ts` - QueueMonitor diagnostic logging
- `hooks/use-project-realtime.ts` - ProjectRealtime diagnostic logging

**Features**:

- Logs broadcast reception with full payload details
- Logs state changes before and after updates
- Logs mutate() calls and results
- Includes deduplication logging
- Includes payload validation logging

### 3. Webhook Logging (✅ Already Implemented)

**Files**:

**Features**:
- `[WEBHOOK-V1]` prefix for all webhook logs
- Logs webhook reception and processing steps
- Logs storage upload operations
- Logs database update operations
- Logs project node updates
- Includes detailed error logging

## Testing Documentation Created

- Test 4.3: Job completion flow with KIE.ai
- Test 4.4: Multi-tab synchronization
- Expected logs for each test
- Troubleshooting guide

**Contents**:
- Quick reference for all log prefixes
- Complete log format documentation
- Log flow diagrams
- Filtering commands for different environments
- Common log patterns (success and failure)
- Debugging commands
- Tips for effective debugging

## How to Test

### Prerequisites

1. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Ensure KIE.ai is configured**:
   - Check `.env` for `KIE_API_KEY`
   - Verify KIE.ai models are available

3. **Open browser DevTools**:
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Enable "Preserve log"

### Quick Test

1. **Navigate to a project**
2. **Open DevTools Console**
3. **Generate an image**:
   - Click on image node
   - Enter prompt: "a beautiful sunset"
   - Select model: `google/nano-banana`
   - Click "Generate"

4. **Watch for logs**:
   - Browser console: `[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC]` logs
   - Server terminal: `[WEBHOOK-V1]` logs
   - Database logs: `[REALTIME]` logs (see LOG_REFERENCE.md for access)

5. **Verify**:
   - Job appears in queue monitor (top-right)
   - After ~10-30 seconds, image appears in node
   - No page refresh needed

### Detailed Testing

Follow the complete guide in `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for:
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Expected log sequences
- Failure identification
- Multi-tab testing
- Log collection templates

## Log Access

### Browser Console Logs
- Open DevTools (F12) > Console tab
- Filter by: `[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC]`, `[WEBHOOK-V1]`, `✅`, `❌`

### Server Logs
- Check terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- Look for `[WEBHOOK-V1]` prefix

### Database Logs

**Local Supabase**:
```bash
# Find container
docker ps | grep supabase_db

# View logs
docker logs -f supabase_db_<project> 2>&1 | grep REALTIME
```

**Remote Supabase**:
- Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Navigate to: Project > Logs > Postgres Logs
- Filter by: `[REALTIME]`

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Indicators

**Job Creation**:
1. Database logs show trigger fired and broadcast sent
2. Browser console shows broadcast received
3. Job appears in queue monitor immediately
4. No page refresh needed

**Job Completion**:
1. Webhook logs show image processing
2. Database logs show fal_jobs UPDATE broadcast
3. Database logs show projects UPDATE broadcast
4. Browser console shows project broadcast received
5. Browser console shows mutate() called
6. Image appears in node immediately
7. No page refresh needed

**Multi-Tab Sync**:
1. Both tabs receive same broadcasts
2. Both tabs update simultaneously
3. No refresh needed in either tab

### ❌ Failure Indicators

**Missing Logs**:
- Any expected log not appearing indicates failure at that step
- Use LOG_REFERENCE.md to identify which step failed

**UI Not Updating**:
- Job doesn't appear in queue → Check database and client logs
- Image doesn't appear in node → Check webhook, database, and client logs
- Requires page refresh → Realtime chain is broken somewhere

## Next Steps

After testing, proceed to:

**Task 5: Analyze logs and identify root cause**
- Collect logs from all tests
- Compare actual logs with expected logs
- Identify which step(s) in the chain are failing
- Document findings
- Propose specific fixes
