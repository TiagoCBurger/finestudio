# Task 5: Log Analysis and Root Cause Identification

## Status: AWAITING TEST EXECUTION

This document will contain the analysis of logs collected from testing the realtime image update flow with KIE.ai.

## Prerequisites

Before analysis can begin, the following tests must be executed:

### Required Tests (from Task 4)

1. **Test 4.2: Job Creation Flow** - Generate an image using KIE.ai and collect logs
2. **Test 4.3: Job Completion Flow** - Wait for webhook and collect completion logs  
3. **Test 4.4: Multi-Tab Synchronization** - Test realtime sync across browser tabs

### How to Execute Tests

Follow the detailed instructions in: `.kiro/specs/fix-realtime-image-updates/TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Quick Start**:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser with DevTools (F12)
3. Navigate to a project
4. Generate image using `google/nano-banana` model
5. Collect logs from:
   - Browser console (filter: `[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC]`)
   - Server terminal (filter: `[WEBHOOK-V1]`)
   - Database logs (filter: `[REALTIME]`)

## Task 5.1: Job Creation Log Analysis

### Objective
Analyze logs from job creation to identify if/where the realtime chain breaks.

### Analysis Checklist

#### Step 1: Database INSERT
- [ ] **Check**: Job was inserted into `fal_jobs` table
- [ ] **Evidence**: Database logs or query result
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Evidence**:
```sql
-- Query to verify
SELECT id, request_id, status, model_id, created_at 
FROM fal_jobs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Step 2: Trigger Invocation
- [ ] **Check**: `notify_fal_job_changes()` trigger fired
- [ ] **Evidence**: Database log with `[REALTIME] fal_jobs trigger invoked`
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```
[REALTIME] fal_jobs trigger invoked: topic=fal_jobs:<user_id>, operation=INSERT, job_id=<id>, timestamp=<time>
[REALTIME] fal_jobs INSERT details: job_id=<id>, status=pending, model_id=google/nano-banana
```

#### Step 3: Broadcast Sent
- [ ] **Check**: `realtime.broadcast_changes()` executed successfully
- [ ] **Evidence**: Database log with `[REALTIME] fal_jobs broadcast SUCCESS`
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```
[REALTIME] fal_jobs broadcast SUCCESS: topic=fal_jobs:<user_id>, operation=INSERT, job_id=<id>
[REALTIME] fal_jobs trigger completed: job_id=<id>, broadcast_result=true, duration_ms=<ms>
```

**If Failed**:
```
[REALTIME] fal_jobs broadcast FAILED: topic=..., error=..., sqlstate=...
```

#### Step 4: Client Received Broadcast
- [ ] **Check**: Browser received WebSocket message
- [ ] **Evidence**: Browser console log with `[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC] QueueMonitor broadcast received`
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```javascript
[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC] QueueMonitor broadcast received: {
  timestamp: "...",
  userId: "...",
  type: "INSERT",
  jobId: "...",
  newStatus: "pending",
  hasNew: true,
  hasOld: false
}
```

#### Step 5: Handler Executed
- [ ] **Check**: `handleJobUpdate()` processed the broadcast
- [ ] **Evidence**: Browser console log with `[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC] Jobs state BEFORE/AFTER update`
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```javascript
[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC] Jobs state BEFORE update: {
  count: 0,
  jobIds: []
}

[REALTIME-DIAGNOSTIC] Jobs state AFTER update: {
  count: 1,
  jobIds: ["<job_id>"],
  wasAdded: true,
  isDuplicate: false
}
```

#### Step 6: React State Updated
- [ ] **Check**: Component re-rendered with new job
- [ ] **Evidence**: Job visible in queue monitor UI
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Visual Verification**:
- Queue monitor (top-right) shows new job
- Job displays: status, model, prompt
- No page refresh was needed

[REALTIME] fal_jobs broadcast SUCCESS
```

#### Step 4: fal_jobs Broadcast Received
- [ ] **Check**: Browser received job completion broadcast
- [ ] **Evidence**: Browser console log with job UPDATE
- [ ] **Status**: ✅ Success / ❌ Failed / ⏳ Not tested

**Expected Log Pattern**:
```javascript

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: No Database Logs at All

**Symptom**: No `[REALTIME]` logs in database

**Likely Causes**:
- Migration not applied
- PostgreSQL log level too high
- Triggers not attached to tables

**How to Verify**:
```sql
-- Check if migration applied
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations 
WHERE version = '20241223000001';

-- Check if triggers exist
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname LIKE '%broadcast%';
```

### Pattern 2: Database Logs Present, No Browser Logs

**Symptom**: Database shows `broadcast SUCCESS` but browser shows nothing

**Likely Causes**:
- WebSocket connection failed
- Subscription not active
- Topic mismatch
- RLS policy blocking

**How to Verify**:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Channels:', Object.keys(window.supabase?.realtime?.channels || {}));
console.log('Connection:', window.supabase?.realtime?.connection?.state);
```

### Pattern 3: Browser Logs Present, UI Not Updating

**Symptom**: Browser receives broadcasts but UI doesn't change

**Likely Causes**:
- React state not updating
- Component not re-rendering
- SWR cache not invalidating

**How to Verify**:
- Check if state update logs appear
- Check React DevTools for state changes
- Check Network tab for API calls

### Pattern 4: Webhook Logs Missing

**Symptom**: Job completes but no webhook logs

**Likely Causes**:
- Webhook URL not configured in KIE.ai
- Webhook endpoint not accessible
- Network/firewall blocking

**How to Verify**:
- Check KIE.ai dashboard for webhook configuration
- Test webhook endpoint manually: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/kie`
- Check server logs for any incoming requests
