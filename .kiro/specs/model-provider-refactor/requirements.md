# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and standardizing the model provider architecture in the Tersa application. The current system has inconsistent implementations across different model types (image, video, text, audio) and providers (KIE, FAL, OpenRouter). The goal is to create a unified, maintainable, and extensible architecture using the KIE (nanobanana) and OpenRouter (text models) implementations as reference patterns, as these are currently working correctly.

## Glossary

- **Provider**: A service that offers AI models (e.g., KIE.ai, FAL.ai, OpenRouter)
- **Model**: A specific AI model offered by a provider (e.g., google/nano-banana, fal-ai/flux-pro)
- **Node**: A visual component in the flow editor that represents a model operation
- **Model_Registry**: Central configuration system that defines available models and their properties
- **Provider_Factory**: Factory pattern implementation for creating provider instances
- **Node_Compatibility**: Rules defining which node types can connect to each other
- **Webhook_Handler**: System for processing asynchronous model generation results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified provider architecture, so that adding new models and providers follows a consistent pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new provider, THE Model_Registry SHALL use a standardized base class pattern
2. WHEN adding a new model, THE Model_Registry SHALL require only configuration changes without code duplication
3. WHEN a provider is created, THE Provider_Factory SHALL instantiate it using consistent parameters
4. WHEN validating provider implementations, THE Model_Registry SHALL enforce interface compliance
5. WHERE provider-specific logic is needed, THE Model_Registry SHALL isolate it in dedicated methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear node compatibility rules, so that users can only connect compatible node types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a model, THE Model_Registry SHALL specify compatible input node types
2. WHEN connecting nodes, THE Node_Compatibility SHALL validate connection rules
3. WHEN a model requires images, THE Node_Compatibility SHALL enforce image node connections
4. WHERE text-to-image models are used, THE Node_Compatibility SHALL allow text-only inputs
5. WHERE image-to-image models are used, THE Node_Compatibility SHALL require image inputs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized request/response handling, so that all providers work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a generation request, THE Provider_Factory SHALL normalize input parameters
2. WHEN receiving provider responses, THE Webhook_Handler SHALL normalize output format
3. WHEN handling errors, THE Provider_Factory SHALL return standardized error types
4. WHERE webhooks are used, THE Webhook_Handler SHALL process all providers uniformly
5. WHERE polling is needed, THE Provider_Factory SHALL implement consistent retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy model configuration, so that enabling/disabling models requires minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring models, THE Model_Registry SHALL use declarative configuration objects
2. WHEN enabling a model, THE Model_Registry SHALL require only configuration flag changes
3. WHEN setting model costs, THE Model_Registry SHALL use standardized pricing structures
4. WHERE model parameters differ, THE Model_Registry SHALL handle variations through configuration
5. WHERE new model types are added, THE Model_Registry SHALL extend without breaking existing models

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation of concerns, so that client and server code are properly isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing client-side code, THE Model_Registry SHALL contain no API keys or server logic
2. WHEN implementing server-side code, THE Provider_Factory SHALL handle all external API calls
3. WHEN sharing types, THE Model_Registry SHALL define common interfaces in shared files
4. WHERE authentication is needed, THE Provider_Factory SHALL handle it server-side only
5. WHERE webhooks are processed, THE Webhook_Handler SHALL run server-side only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that failures are properly categorized and handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail, THE Provider_Factory SHALL categorize errors by type and retry capability
2. WHEN validation fails, THE Model_Registry SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN webhooks fail, THE Webhook_Handler SHALL log errors with sufficient context
4. WHERE network issues occur, THE Provider_Factory SHALL implement appropriate retry strategies
5. WHERE user errors occur, THE Model_Registry SHALL provide actionable feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file organization, so that finding and maintaining code is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing provider code, THE Model_Registry SHALL follow consistent directory structures
2. WHEN separating concerns, THE Provider_Factory SHALL isolate client and server implementations
3. WHEN defining types, THE Model_Registry SHALL centralize shared interfaces
4. WHERE tests are needed, THE Provider_Factory SHALL co-locate test files with implementation
5. WHERE documentation is needed, THE Model_Registry SHALL maintain up-to-date provider documentation
