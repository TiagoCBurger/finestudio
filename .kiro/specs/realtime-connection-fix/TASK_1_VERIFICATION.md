# Task 1 Verification: RealtimeConnectionManager Singleton

## Implementation Summary

Created `lib/realtime-connection-manager.ts` with the following components:

### ✅ Singleton Pattern (Requirement 1.1)
- `RealtimeConnectionManager` class with private constructor
- Static `getInstance()` method that returns the same instance
- Static `resetInstance()` method for testing purposes

### ✅ Channel Registry (Requirement 1.2, 1.3)
- `Map<string, ChannelWrapper>` to track all active channels
- Channel reuse logic: checks if channel exists before creating new one
- Automatic channel cleanup when last subscriber unsubscribes

### ✅ Subscriber Registry (Requirement 1.3)
- `ChannelWrapper` class manages subscribers per channel
- `Map<string, SubscriberInfo>` tracks all subscribers with metadata:
  - Unique subscriber ID
  - Event name
  - Callback function
  - Timestamp when added
- Methods for adding/removing subscribers
- Reference counting via `getSubscriberCount()`

### ✅ Connection State Management (Requirement 1.4)
- `ConnectionState` type with 5 states:
  - `disconnected`
  - `connecting`
  - `connected`
  - `reconnecting`
  - `error`
- `getConnectionState()` method to query current state
- `getActiveChannels()` method to inspect all channels

### ✅ Cleanup Method (Requirement 1.5)
- `cleanup()` method that:
  - Closes all active channels
  - Removes all channels from Supabase client
  - Clears the channel registry
  - Resets connection state to disconnected
- Individual channel cleanup via `ChannelWrapper.close()`
- Automatic cleanup when subscriber count reaches zero

## Key Features Implemented

### ChannelWrapper Class
- Manages individual channels and their subscribers
- Tracks channel state (idle, subscribing, subscribed, error, closed)
- Reference counting for automatic cleanup
- Event routing to appropriate subscribers

### Core Methods

1. **subscribe(topic, event, callback, options)**
   - Creates or reuses channel for topic
   - Adds subscriber to channel
   - Returns SubscriptionHandle for unsubscribing
   - Supports private channels with authentication

2. **unsubscribe(handle)**
   - Removes subscriber from channel
   - Automatically closes channel if no subscribers remain
   - Cleans up resources properly

3. **broadcast(topic, event, payload)**
   - Sends messages to a channel
   - Validates channel state before sending
   - Error handling with logging

4. **cleanup()**
   - Closes all channels
   - Removes all subscriptions
   - Resets manager state

## Integration with Existing Code

- Uses existing `createClient()` from `lib/supabase/client.ts` (singleton Supabase client)
- Uses existing `realtimeLogger` for consistent logging
- Compatible with Supabase Realtime API
- Follows Supabase best practices (private channels, broadcast events)

## Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1.1 - Single Supabase client | Uses `createClient()` singleton | ✅ |
| 1.2 - Reuse client instance | `ensureClient()` method | ✅ |
| 1.3 - Don't close on unmount | Manager persists, only channels close | ✅ |
| 1.4 - Singleton client | `getInstance()` pattern | ✅ |
| 1.5 - One WebSocket connection | Single client, multiple channels | ✅ |

## Testing

Created test files:
- `lib/__tests__/realtime-connection-manager.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `lib/__tests__/verify-realtime-manager.ts` - Manual verification script

Tests verify:
- Singleton pattern enforcement
- Channel registry functionality
- Subscriber management
- Cleanup behavior
- State management

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Task 2: Implement ChannelWrapper class (✅ Already included)
- Task 3: Implement core subscription methods (✅ Already included)
- Task 5: Create useRealtimeSubscription hook (will use this manager)
- Task 8-9: Refactor existing hooks to use this manager

## Files Created

1. `lib/realtime-connection-manager.ts` - Main implementation (450+ lines)
2. `lib/__tests__/realtime-connection-manager.test.ts` - Unit tests
3. `lib/__tests__/verify-realtime-manager.ts` - Verification script
4. `.kiro/specs/realtime-connection-fix/TASK_1_VERIFICATION.md` - This document

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript with full type safety
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Error handling throughout
- ✅ No TypeScript diagnostics errors
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Implements all design document specifications
