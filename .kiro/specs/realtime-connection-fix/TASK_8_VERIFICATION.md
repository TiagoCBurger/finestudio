# Task 8 Verification: Refactor useProjectRealtime Hook

## Overview

Successfully refactored the `useProjectRealtime` hook to use the new `useRealtimeSubscription` hook from the RealtimeConnectionManager. The refactored implementation is significantly simpler while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Implementation

**Before:**
- ~600 lines of complex subscription management code
- Manual Supabase client creation
- Custom debouncing and retry logic
- Manual channel state tracking
- Complex error handling

**After:**
- ~150 lines of clean, focused code
- Uses centralized RealtimeConnectionManager
- Delegates connection management to `useRealtimeSubscription`
- Maintains backward-compatible API

### 2. Key Improvements

#### Removed Complexity
- ❌ Removed manual Supabase client creation (`createClient()`)
- ❌ Removed manual channel management (`channelRef`, `supabaseRef`)
- ❌ Removed custom debouncing logic (`debounceTimerRef`)
- ❌ Removed manual retry logic with exponential backoff
- ❌ Removed manual state tracking (`subscriptionStateRef`)
- ❌ Removed manual session management and auth setup

#### Added Benefits
- ✅ Uses centralized connection manager (single WebSocket)
- ✅ Automatic channel reuse across components
- ✅ Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Proper cleanup handled by manager
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Better logging and debugging

### 3. Backward Compatibility

The hook maintains the same API for existing consumers:

```typescript
// Usage remains the same
const { subscriptionState, retrySubscription } = useProjectRealtime(projectId);

// Return type is identical
interface UseProjectRealtimeReturn {
    subscriptionState: SubscriptionState;
    retrySubscription: () => void;
}
```

### 4. Code Structure

```typescript
export function useProjectRealtime(projectId: string | undefined): UseProjectRealtimeReturn {
    // 1. Define message handler
    const handleProjectUpdate = useCallback((payload: ProjectUpdatePayload) => {
        // Validate payload
        // Log received message
        // Call SWR mutate() to revalidate cache
    }, [projectId]);

    // 2. Subscribe using new hook
    const { isSubscribed, connectionState, error, retry } = useRealtimeSubscription({
        topic: `project:${projectId}`,
        event: 'UPDATE',
        onMessage: handleProjectUpdate,
        enabled: !!projectId,
        private: true,
        self: false,
        ack: true
    });

    // 3. Map to old API for backward compatibility
    const subscriptionState: SubscriptionState = {
        isSubscribing: connectionState === 'connecting',
        isSubscribed: isSubscribed,
        retryCount: 0,
        lastAttemptTimestamp: null,
        lastError: error ? { /* map error */ } : undefined
    };

    // 4. Return compatible interface
    return {
        subscriptionState,
        retrySubscription: retry
    };
}
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **1.1, 1.2, 1.3** - Uses centralized connection manager (single WebSocket, shared client)
✅ **2.1, 2.2, 2.3** - Channel reuse handled by manager
✅ **3.1** - Proper cleanup handled by `useRealtimeSubscription`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Basic Subscription**
   ```bash
   # Start the dev server
   npm run dev
   
   # Open a project page
   # Check browser console for subscription logs
   # Should see: "Starting subscription" and "Subscription successful"
   ```

2. **Project Updates**
   ```bash
   # Make changes to the canvas
   # Save the project
   # Verify SWR revalidation is triggered
   # Should see: "Broadcast received" and "mutate() called successfully"
   ```

3. **Multiple Components**
   ```bash
   # Open the same project in two browser tabs
   # Make changes in one tab
   # Verify the other tab receives updates
   # Should see channel reuse in logs
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```bash
   # Disconnect network
   # Verify automatic reconnection attempts
   # Reconnect network
   # Verify subscription is restored
   ```

### Expected Behavior

1. **Single Connection**: Only one WebSocket connection to Supabase
2. **Channel Reuse**: Same channel used across multiple subscriptions
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Resources freed when component unmounts
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. **SWR Integration**: Project cache revalidated on updates

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Hook compiles without TypeScript errors
- [x] Maintains backward-compatible API
- [x] Uses `useRealtimeSubscription` hook
- [x] Removes old Supabase client creation
- [x] Simplifies to focus on project updates only
- [x] Proper cleanup handled by manager
- [x] Error handling delegated to manager
- [x] Logging preserved for debugging

## Code Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Lines of Code | ~600 | ~150 | 75% reduction |
| Dependencies | 5 imports | 3 imports | 40% reduction |
| Complexity | High | Low | Significant |
| Maintainability | Low | High | Significant |

## Next Steps

The refactored hook is ready for use. Next tasks:

1. **Task 9**: Refactor `useQueueMonitor` hook
2. **Task 10**: Add multi-window synchronization
3. **Task 11**: Update authentication handling
4. **Task 12**: Integration and cleanup

## Notes

- The hook now subscribes only to 'UPDATE' events (most common for project modifications)
- INSERT and DELETE events can be added later if needed
- The RealtimeConnectionManager handles all connection complexity
- Error handling and retry logic are now centralized
- The hook is much easier to test and maintain
