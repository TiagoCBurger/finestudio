# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical client-side error occurring during image generation: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')". The error happens in the `transform.tsx` component when processing incoming nodes, preventing users from generating images despite the server-side webhook processing working correctly.

## Glossary

- **ImageTransform Component**: The React component responsible for handling image generation UI and logic in `components/nodes/image/transform.tsx`
- **Incomers**: Nodes connected as inputs to the current image node in the React Flow graph
- **getIncomers**: React Flow function that returns an array of nodes connected to a given node
- **getTextFromTextNodes**: Utility function that extracts text content from text nodes
- **getImagesFromImageNodes**: Utility function that extracts image data from image nodes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user generating an image, I want the application to handle missing or invalid node connections gracefully, so that I can generate images without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System calls `getIncomers()`, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL validate that the returned value is an array before processing
2. WHEN THE System receives an undefined or null value from `getIncomers()`, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL initialize it as an empty array
3. WHEN THE System processes incomers array, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL validate each node structure before accessing properties
4. IF `getTextFromTextNodes()` or `getImagesFromImageNodes()` throws an error, THEN THE ImageTransform Component SHALL catch the error and initialize the result as an empty array
5. WHEN validation fails for node data, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log detailed diagnostic information including node IDs and data structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when image generation fails due to missing inputs, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System detects no valid text or image inputs, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL display a user-friendly error message stating "No input provided"
2. WHEN THE System encounters a node processing error, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log the error with context but not block the generation process
3. WHEN THE System validates incomers, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log the count and structure of incoming nodes for debugging
4. IF node validation fails, THEN THE ImageTransform Component SHALL continue processing with valid nodes only
5. WHEN THE System displays an error, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL include actionable guidance for the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging in the image generation flow, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System encounters any error in `handleGenerate`, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log the error with timestamp, stack trace, and current state
2. WHEN THE System processes incomers, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log node count, IDs, types, and data structure
3. WHEN THE System calls utility functions, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL wrap calls in try-catch blocks with specific error messages
4. IF an error occurs during node validation, THEN THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log which validation step failed
5. WHEN THE System detects a map-related error, THE ImageTransform Component SHALL log additional diagnostic context about the data structure being processed
