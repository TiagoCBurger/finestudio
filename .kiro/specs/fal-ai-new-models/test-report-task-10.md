# Test Report - Task 10: Manual Testing of Video Models

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Task:** Testar modelos de vídeo manualmente  
**Status:** Ready for Manual Testing  
**Requirements:** 4.1, 4.3, 5.1, 5.3

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive manual testing guide for the two new Fal.ai video models:
- **Kling Video v2.5 Turbo Pro** (`fal-kling-v2.5-turbo-pro`)
- **Sora 2 Pro** (`fal-sora-2-pro`)

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Code Review Completed

**Files Verified:**
1. `lib/models/video/fal.ts` - Fal.ai video provider implementation
2. `lib/models/video/index.ts` - Model registry with both new models

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Both models are registered in the video models registry
- Cost calculation functions are implemented:
  - Kling: $0.35 for 5s, $0.70 for 10s
  - Sora 2 Pro: $1.20 fixed for 5s
- Polling mechanism implemented with appropriate timeouts:
  - Kling: 3 minutes max
  - Sora 2 Pro: 6 minutes max
- Image-to-video validation: Both models require an image input
- Error handling for API failures and timeouts

### Test 2: Generate Video with Kling Video v2.5 Turbo Pro

**Objective:** Test video generation with Kling model and verify all functionality

**Setup:**
1. Create a new project or use existing test project
2. Add an Image node with a test image (e.g., `public/demo/delphiniums-anime.jpg`)
3. Add a Text node with a prompt (e.g., "The flowers gently sway in the breeze")
4. Add a Video node
5. Connect Image node → Video node
6. Connect Text node → Video node

**Test Steps:**
1. Select "Kling Video v2.5 Turbo Pro (Fal)" from the model dropdown
2. Add optional instructions in the video node textarea (e.g., "Smooth, natural motion")
3. Click the Play button to generate video
4. Observe the generation process

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Generation starts immediately (loading spinner appears)
- [ ] Console logs show "Fal.ai video request" with correct parameters:
  - `modelId: "fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/image-to-video"`
  - `hasImage: true`
  - `duration: 5`
  - `aspectRatio: "16:9"`
- [ ] Polling occurs (check console for status checks every 3 seconds)
- [ ] Video generation completes within 3 minutes
- [ ] Generated video appears in the node
- [ ] Video plays automatically (autoplay, muted, loop)
- [ ] Download button appears after generation
- [ ] "Last updated" timestamp is shown

**Cost Verification:**
- [ ] Check credits balance before generation
- [ ] After generation, verify $0.35 was deducted (for 5s video)
- [ ] Cost calculation matches: `duration <= 5 ? 0.35 : 0.70`

**Video Quality Check:**
- [ ] Video resolution is appropriate (HD quality)
- [ ] Motion is smooth and natural
- [ ] Video matches the prompt description
- [ ] No artifacts or glitches visible

### Test 3: Generate Video with Sora 2 Pro

**Objective:** Test video generation with Sora 2 Pro model and verify premium quality

**Setup:**
1. Use the same project setup as Test 2, or create a new one
2. Use a different test image for variety (e.g., `public/demo/delphiniums-fantasy.jpg`)
3. Use a descriptive prompt (e.g., "Magical sparkles float around the flowers as they bloom")

**Test Steps:**
1. Select "Sora 2 Pro (Fal)" from the model dropdown
2. Add optional instructions (e.g., "Cinematic, high-quality animation")
3. Click the Play button to generate video
4. Observe the generation process (note: may take longer than Kling)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Generation starts immediately (loading spinner appears)
- [ ] Console logs show "Fal.ai video request" with correct parameters:
  - `modelId: "fal-ai/sora-2/image-to-video/pro"`
  - `hasImage: true`
  - `duration: 5`
  - `aspectRatio: "16:9"`
- [ ] Polling occurs (check console for status checks every 3 seconds)
- [ ] Video generation completes within 6 minutes
- [ ] Generated video appears in the node
- [ ] Video plays automatically
- [ ] Download button appears after generation
- [ ] "Last updated" timestamp is shown

**Cost Verification:**
- [ ] Check credits balance before generation
- [ ] After generation, verify $1.20 was deducted (fixed cost for 5s)
- [ ] Cost calculation is fixed at $1.20 regardless of duration parameter

**Video Quality Check:**
- [ ] Video quality is noticeably higher than Kling (premium quality)
- [ ] Motion is ultra-realistic and smooth
- [ ] Physics and lighting are accurate
- [ ] Video demonstrates Sora's advanced capabilities

### Test 4: Error Handling - Missing Image Input

**Objective:** Verify proper error handling when image input is missing

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a Video node without connecting an Image node
2. Connect only a Text node with a prompt
3. Select either Kling or Sora model
4. Click the Play button

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Error message appears: "requires an image input (image-to-video)"
- [ ] Generation does not proceed
- [ ] User is informed that image is required
- [ ] No credits are deducted

---

### Test 5: Polling and Timeout Behavior

**Objective:** Verify polling mechanism works correctly

**Test Steps:**
1. Generate a video with either model
2. Monitor browser console during generation
3. Observe network requests in DevTools

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Initial POST request to `https://fal.run/fal-ai/[model-id]`
- [ ] Response contains `request_id`
- [ ] Polling GET requests to `https://fal.run/fal-ai/[model-id]/requests/[request_id]`
- [ ] Polling interval is 3 seconds
- [ ] Polling continues until status is "completed" or "failed"
- [ ] If timeout occurs (3min for Kling, 6min for Sora), appropriate error is shown

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
Fal.ai video request: {
  modelId: "fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/image-to-video",
  hasImage: true,
  duration: 5,
  aspectRatio: "16:9"
}
```

### Test 6: Cost Calculation Accuracy

**Objective:** Verify cost calculations match specifications

**Test Matrix:**

| Model | Duration | Expected Cost | Actual Cost | Pass/Fail |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Kling v2.5 Turbo Pro | 5s | $0.35 | | ☐ |
| Kling v2.5 Turbo Pro | 10s | $0.70 | | ☐ |
| Sora 2 Pro | 5s | $1.20 | | ☐ |

**Note:** Currently, the application uses a fixed duration of 5 seconds. To test 10s duration for Kling, code modification would be needed in `app/actions/video/create.ts`.

### Test 7: Regeneration and Download

**Objective:** Verify regeneration and download functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Generate a video with either model
2. Click the Regenerate button (circular arrow icon)
3. Wait for new video to generate
4. Click the Download button

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Regeneration creates a new video (different from first)
- [ ] New video replaces the old one in the node
- [ ] Credits are deducted again for regeneration
- [ ] Download button downloads the video as MP4
- [ ] Downloaded file is playable and matches the displayed video
