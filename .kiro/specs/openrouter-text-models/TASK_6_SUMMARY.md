# Task 6 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the OpenRouter text models registry into the TextTransform component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added `getEnabledTextModels` and `TextModel` from `@/lib/models/text`
- Added `providers` from `@/lib/providers` for proper provider icons
- Renamed `models` to `gatewayModels` for clarity

### 2. Model Merging Logic
Created `allModels` useMemo that:
- Fetches enabled OpenRouter models via `getEnabledTextModels()`
- Converts OpenRouter models to TersaModel format
- Extracts provider from model ID (e.g., "openai" from "openai/gpt-5-pro")
- Uses proper provider icons (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google icons)
- Calculates costs correctly based on input/output pricing
- Merges with Gateway models

### 3. Updated getDefaultModel
- Changed signature to accept `Record<string, TersaModel | TextModel>`
- Properly checks for `default` property in models
- Falls back to 'o3' if no default found

### 4. ModelSelector Integration
- Updated to use `allModels` instead of `models`
- Updated dependency array in toolbar useMemo

## Requirements Met

✅ **Requirement 2.1**: OpenRouter models appear in model selector
✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Selected OpenRouter models are used for text generation
✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Costs calculated correctly based on OpenRouter pricing
